<h1>Company Database Design - SQL</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project involved creating a comprehensive database schema for a company based on their specific data needs. Using SQL (MySQL), I designed and implemented tables for employees, branches, clients, and branch suppliers, ensuring proper relationships using primary and foreign keys derived from an ER Diagram. Additionally, SQL queries, including JOIN operations, were employed to extract essential information from different tables within the database. This project showcases database design proficiency and SQL querying skills tailored to meet organizational requirements effectively.
